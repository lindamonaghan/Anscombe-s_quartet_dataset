# Anscombe-s_quartet_dataset
The Anscombe's quartet dataset is important for teaching the importance of graphics in data analysis. It consists of four datasets that have identical summmary statistics but disimiliar data graphics.

This repository contains an investigation into the Anscomb's Quartet Dataset.

The first section explains the background to the dataset, who created it, when it was created and any information I could find regarding how it may have been created.

Then the dataset is plotted. This shows how once plotted the datasets that seem very similiar are actually quite disimiliar.

Following on from this the descriptive statistics of the dataset are investigated.

The repository ends with a conclusion and summary of findings based on the plots and statistics calculated throughout the notebook.
